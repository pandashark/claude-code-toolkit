## From Chaos to System

Claude Code provides the tools, we provide the methodology.

### The Problem

AI-assisted coding is powerful but chaotic:
- ❌ **Context limits** force you to restart mid-task
- ❌ **Memory loss** when switching between features
- ❌ **No systematic preservation** of decisions and patterns
- ❌ **Quality inconsistencies** - sometimes amazing, sometimes breaks things

### The Solution

**Structured workflows + Persistent memory + Quality automation**

Claude Code Plugins transforms AI-assisted development from freestyle conversations into a systematic, repeatable process.

---

## Core Features

### 🔄 Structured Workflow
```bash
/explore → /plan → /next → /ship
```
Break down complex work into tracked, dependent tasks with the proven 4-phase methodology.

### 💾 Memory Management
Persistent context across sessions with automatic reflection and cleanup. Never lose project knowledge again.

### ✅ Quality Automation
Safe git commits, pre/post tool execution hooks, compliance auditing. Built-in quality gates prevent mistakes.

### 🔌 MCP Integration
Proven patterns for Serena (70-90% token reduction), Chrome DevTools, Context7, Sequential Thinking.

### 🤖 Specialized Agents
6 expert agents: architect, test-engineer, code-reviewer, auditor, data-scientist, report-generator.
