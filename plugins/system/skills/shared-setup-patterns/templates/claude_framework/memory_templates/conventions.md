# Project Conventions

Document project-specific conventions that differ from global standards.

## Code Style
- Formatting: (e.g., ruff, prettier, gofmt)
- Naming: (e.g., snake_case for Python, camelCase for JavaScript)
- Import order: (e.g., standard lib → third party → local)

## Git Conventions
- Branch naming: (e.g., feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
- Commit message format: (e.g., conventional commits)
- PR requirements: (e.g., tests must pass, review required)

## Testing Conventions
- Test file naming: (e.g., test_*.py, *.test.js)
- Test organization: (e.g., mirrors src/ structure)
- Coverage requirements: (e.g., minimum 80%)

## Documentation
- Code comments: When and how to document
- README sections: Required sections
- API documentation: Format and location
