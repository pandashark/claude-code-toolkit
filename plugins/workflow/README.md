# Workflow Plugin

Structured development workflow for systematic task completion - explore, plan, implement, and deliver.

## Overview

The Workflow plugin provides a proven 4-phase development methodology for Claude Code. It guides you from initial requirements exploration through systematic planning, task execution, and final delivery. This workflow ensures thorough analysis, organized implementation, and quality delivery.

## The 4-Phase Workflow

```
/explore → /plan → /next (repeat) → /ship
   ↓         ↓          ↓             ↓
Analyze   Design   Implement      Deliver
```

### Phase 1: Explore
Understand requirements, analyze codebase, identify constraints and opportunities.

### Phase 2: Plan
Create detailed implementation plan with ordered tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

### Phase 3: Execute
Implement tasks one at a time with /next, completing the plan systematically.

### Phase 4: Deliver
Ship completed work with validation, documentation, and quality assurance.

## Commands

### `/explore [source] [--work-unit ID]`
Explore requirements and codebase with systematic analysis before planning. This is Anthropic's recommended first step for any significant task.

**What it does**:
- Analyzes requirements from multiple sources (@file, #issue, description, or interactive)
- Explores relevant codebase areas to understand context
- Identifies constraints, dependencies, and risks
- Documents findings for planning phase
- Creates work unit for tracking

**Usage**:
```bash
/explore                                    # Interactive exploration
/explore "Add user authentication"          # From description
/explore @requirements.md                   # From requirements doc
/explore #123                               # From GitHub issue
/explore --work-unit 001                    # Use existing work unit
```

**Thoroughness Levels**:
- `quick`: Basic search and analysis (5-10 minutes)
- `medium`: Moderate exploration with multiple angles (15-25 minutes)
- `very thorough`: Comprehensive analysis across codebase (30-45 minutes)

**Output**:
- `exploration.md`: Detailed findings and analysis
- `metadata.json`: Work unit tracking information

**When to use**:
- ✅ Starting any non-trivial feature or bug fix
- ✅ Unclear requirements that need investigation
- ✅ Unfamiliar codebase areas
- ✅ Complex changes with many dependencies

**When to skip**:
- ❌ Trivial changes (typo fixes, simple updates)
- ❌ Very clear requirements in familiar code
- ❌ Quick experiments or spikes

### `/plan [--from-requirements | --from-issue #123 | description]`
Create detailed implementation plan with ordered tasks and dependencies using structured reasoning.

**What it does**:
- Reviews exploration findings (or analyzes requirements directly)
- Breaks work into ordered, manageable tasks
- Identifies dependencies and sequencing
- Defines acceptance criteria for each task
- Creates task tracking state file

**Usage**:
```bash
/plan                                       # From latest /explore
/plan --from-requirements @specs.md         # From requirements doc
/plan --from-issue #123                     # From GitHub issue
/plan "Implement OAuth login"               # From description
```

**Plan Structure**:
- **Tasks**: Ordered list with IDs, descriptions, dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Task relationships and sequencing
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Estimates**: Rough time/complexity estimates

**Output**:
- `implementation-plan.md`: Complete task breakdown
- `state.json`: Task tracking state (pending, in_progress, completed)

**When to use**:
- ✅ After /explore for complex work
- ✅ Multi-step features requiring coordination
- ✅ Changes affecting multiple files/systems
- ✅ Work that will span multiple sessions

**When to skip**:
- ❌ Single-file, single-function changes
- ❌ Immediate fixes that are obvious
- ❌ Exploratory work without clear endpoint

### `/next [--task TASK-ID | --preview | --status]`
Execute the next available task from the implementation plan.

**What it does**:
- Loads implementation plan and current state
- Identifies next task based on dependencies
- Executes the task completely
- Updates state.json automatically
- Moves to next task when ready

**Usage**:
```bash
/next                                       # Execute next available task
/next --preview                             # Show what's next without executing
/next --status                              # Show plan progress
/next --task TASK-005                       # Execute specific task
```

**Task Execution Flow**:
1. Load plan and check dependencies
2. Display current task details
3. Execute implementation
4. Verify completion against acceptance criteria
5. Update state.json (pending → in_progress → completed)
6. Show progress and next task

**States**:
- `pending`: Not yet started
- `in_progress`: Currently working on
- `completed`: Finished and verified
- `blocked`: Waiting on dependencies

**When to use**:
- ✅ Systematic implementation of planned work
- ✅ Multiple tasks that should be done in order
- ✅ Work that needs tracking across sessions
- ✅ Complex features with many steps

**Tips**:
- Run `/next --status` frequently to see progress
- Use `/next --preview` before starting if unsure
- Tasks complete in dependency order automatically

### `/ship [--preview | --pr | --commit | --deploy]`
Deliver completed work with validation and comprehensive documentation.

**What it does**:
- Reviews completed implementation plan
- Validates all acceptance criteria met
- Runs tests and quality checks
- Creates comprehensive documentation
- Generates git commits or pull requests
- Produces delivery summary

**Usage**:
```bash
/ship                                       # Full delivery workflow
/ship --preview                             # Preview what will be delivered
/ship --commit                              # Create git commit only
/ship --pr                                  # Create pull request
/ship --deploy                              # Prepare for deployment
```

**Delivery Checklist**:
- ✅ All planned tasks completed
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Code reviewed (self or automated)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Breaking changes documented
- ✅ Migration guides (if needed)

**Output**:
- `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`: What was delivered and how to use it
- Git commit or pull request (if requested)
- Test results and quality metrics
- Deployment instructions (if applicable)

**When to use**:
- ✅ Implementation plan complete
- ✅ Feature ready for review/merge
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Quality checks passed

**Options**:
- `--preview`: See what will be shipped without doing it
- `--commit`: Create git commit with generated message
- `--pr`: Create GitHub pull request with summary
- `--deploy`: Include deployment checklist and instructions

### `/work [subcommand] [args]`
Unified work management - list units, continue work, save checkpoints, and switch contexts.

**What it does**:
- Lists active, paused, and completed work units
- Continues work from previous sessions
- Creates checkpoints for context switching
- Switches between parallel work streams

**Usage**:
```bash
/work                                      # List all work units
/work continue                             # Resume last active work unit
/work checkpoint "Switching to bug fix"    # Save checkpoint before context switch
/work switch 002                           # Switch to work unit 002
/work active                               # Show only active work units
/work completed                            # Show completed work units
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ Managing multiple parallel work streams
- ✅ Context switching between tasks
- ✅ Resuming work after interruptions
- ✅ Tracking work unit status

### `/spike [topic] [timebox]`
Time-boxed exploration in isolated branch for investigating uncertain approaches.

**What it does**:
- Creates isolated git branch for experimentation
- Time-boxes exploration (default: 2 hours)
- Documents findings and recommendations
- Easy to merge or discard results

**Usage**:
```bash
/spike "GraphQL vs REST API" 2h            # 2-hour spike
/spike "Redis caching strategy" 1h         # 1-hour spike
/spike "New authentication library"        # Default 2-hour spike
```

**Output**:
- Isolated git branch (`spike/topic-name`)
- Findings document with recommendations
- Code examples (if applicable)
- Decision: proceed, modify, or abandon

**When to use**:
- ✅ High uncertainty in approach
- ✅ Need to compare multiple solutions
- ✅ Investigating new libraries or patterns
- ✅ Risk mitigation before committing to design

**Benefits**:
- Isolated from main work (git branch)
- Time-boxed to prevent rabbit holes
- Documented findings for future reference
- Easy to discard if approach doesn't work

## Complete Workflow Example

### Example: Adding User Authentication

```bash
# Phase 1: Explore
/explore "Add JWT-based authentication to API"

# Output: exploration.md with findings:
# - Existing auth middleware
# - JWT library already in dependencies
# - 3 endpoints need protection
# - User model needs password hashing

# Phase 2: Plan
/plan

# Output: implementation-plan.md with 6 tasks:
# TASK-001: Add password hashing to User model
# TASK-002: Create JWT token generation utilities
# TASK-003: Implement login endpoint
# TASK-004: Create auth middleware
# TASK-005: Protect existing endpoints
# TASK-006: Add integration tests

# Phase 3: Execute
/next --status
# Shows: TASK-001 ready, others pending

/next
# Implements TASK-001, updates state.json

/next
# Implements TASK-002 (dependency of TASK-001 complete)

/next
# ... continues through all tasks

# Phase 4: Deliver
/ship --pr
# Creates pull request with:
# - Summary of 6 completed tasks
# - Test results (all passing)
# - Breaking changes documentation
# - Migration guide for existing users
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Full Workflow

✅ **Use /explore → /plan → /next → /ship for**:
- Multi-file features
- Unfamiliar codebase areas
- Complex business logic
- Work spanning multiple sessions
- Team collaboration (plan serves as spec)

### When to Skip Workflow

❌ **Skip workflow for**:
- Single-line fixes
- Documentation updates
- Typo corrections
- Configuration tweaks
- Quick experiments

### Workflow Variations

**Quick Mode** (skip /explore):
```bash
/plan "Simple, clear task"
/next
/ship --commit
```

**Investigation Mode** (explore only):
```bash
/explore "Complex problem"
# Review findings, decide approach
# May not lead to implementation
```

**Iterative Mode** (re-plan as you learn):
```bash
/explore
/plan
/next
# Discover new requirements
/plan --update  # Adjust plan
/next
/ship
```

## Troubleshooting

### /explore finds nothing
- Broaden search terms
- Use `very thorough` mode
- Manually specify file patterns to search
- Check if you're in correct directory

### /plan creates too many tasks
- Tasks should be 30min - 2hr each
- Merge small tasks
- Use subtasks in descriptions

### /next shows "no tasks available"
- Run `/next --status` to check dependencies
- Tasks may be blocked waiting on others
- Check `state.json` for task states

### /ship validation fails
- Review acceptance criteria in plan
- Run tests manually: `/test`
- Check code quality: `/review`
- Fix issues: `/fix`

## Metrics and Success

The workflow tracks:
- **Exploration time**: How long /explore takes
- **Task completion rate**: Completed vs. total tasks
- **Plan accuracy**: How often plan matches reality
- **Quality metrics**: Test coverage, review feedback

View with:
```bash
/status verbose
/performance
```
