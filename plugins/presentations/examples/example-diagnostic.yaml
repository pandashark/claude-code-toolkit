# Executive framing using SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution)
executive_summary:
  situation: >
    Pipeline generation grew 12% YoY but win rates declined from 31% to 25%,
    with quarterly slip rates exceeding 50% (benchmark: 15-20%).
  complication: >
    The decline is not uniform - it concentrates in Commercial segments and
    specific channels, while 11 commonly-held beliefs about root causes
    are contradicted by data.
  resolution: >
    A hybrid model redirecting GSD to proven pockets of value while
    reinforcing Core Rep coverage, combined with measurement standardization,
    can recover 4-8pp of conversion within 90 days.
