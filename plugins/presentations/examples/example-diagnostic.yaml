title: "Pipeline Conversion Diagnostic"
subtitle: "Final Readout: Findings & Recommendations"
date: "February 2026"
author: "Revenue Operations Analytics"
audience: "PLT Decision Meeting"
deck_type: decision-meeting
classification: confidential
duration_minutes: 50

executive_summary:
  situation: "Pipeline grew 12% YoY but win rates fell 31% to 25%; slip rates 50%+ (benchmark 15-20%)"
  complication: "11 stakeholder claims contradicted; decline concentrated in Commercial; 18.2pp method variance"
  resolution: "Hybrid Model: GSD to Commercial/APAC/ITSM-Impact; Core Rep for Enterprise; standardize measurement; activate 7 levers"
  governing_thought: "Decline concentrated in Commercial (-9.8pp) while Enterprise/Strategic improve. Biggest risks: upstream quality, measurement inconsistency, GSD deployed to wrong segments."
  key_numbers:
    - "35 hypotheses tested | 11 claims contradicted | 7 levers"
    - "Option 4 (Hybrid Model) scored 4.20/5.00"

methodology:
  scope: "42 hypotheses across 5 decision areas"
  approach: "Statistical testing with propensity matching, causal inference"
  population: "227,104 opps (NET_NEW_ACV > 0), FY23-FY25"
  data_sources: ["Snowflake (10 tables)", "Stage history", "Multi-method attribution"]
  caveats: ["FY25 ~27% still open", "7 hypotheses skipped (missing data)"]

    - {claim: "Platform & AI worst maturation", source: "Marketing", verdict: CONTRADICTED, reality: "Actually BEST at 63.9% vs 44.4%", hypothesis_id: "D3"}
    - {claim: "Now Assist adds 4-5pp", source: "Vijay", verdict: CONTRADICTED, reality: "+19pp actual (4x); 87% after controls", hypothesis_id: "D4"}
    - {claim: "<2 slips = better outcomes", source: "D&A", verdict: CONTRADICTED, reality: "2+ slips convert BETTER", hypothesis_id: "E10"}
    - {claim: "Day 5 closure declined 12pts", source: "Vijay", verdict: CONTRADICTED, reality: "Day 5 improved +5.1pp; Cohort -15.4pp", hypothesis_id: "E11"}
    - {claim: "Coverage 3.5-4.7x", source: "Field", verdict: CONTRADICTED, reality: "Actual 2.1-2.5x", hypothesis_id: "E12"}
