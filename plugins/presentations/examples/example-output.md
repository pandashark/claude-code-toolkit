## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** Pipeline Conversion Diagnostic

**Subtitle:** Final Readout: Findings & Recommendations

**Date:** February 2026

**Prepared for:** PLT Decision Meeting

*Footer: 1 | CONFIDENTIAL*

**Presenter Notes:**
> "Seven weeks ago we agreed to five tests and a decision commitment. Today we deliver on that. 35 hypotheses tested, 5 decisions answered, a clear recommendation with data behind every claim."

**Leave-Behind Notes:**
This deck presents the final findings of the 7-week Pipeline Conversion Diagnostic commissioned by GP&O. 35 of 42 hypotheses were tested across 5 decision areas (Source Performance, Sales Execution, Demand Gen Model, Market Fit, Measurement). The study identifies root causes of conversion decline and recommends a Hybrid Model implementation with measurement standardization as prerequisite.

## Slide 2: Executive Summary

**Action Title:** Conversion decline is real but concentrated, not uniform--the organization is operating on a flawed narrative built on 11 contradicted claims

**Supporting Argument:** SCR Framework (updated from Day 1)

| Situation | Complication | Resolution |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Conversion declining across sources; 29.8pp channel spread; 50%+ slip rates | 11 major stakeholder claims contradicted by data; decline concentrated in Commercial while Enterprise/Strategic improve; 18.2pp method variance produces contradictory trend narratives | Hybrid Model: deploy GSD where it works, redirect where it doesn't; standardize measurement; activate proven levers (Now Assist +19pp, partners +4.3pp, stage discipline +21.5pp) |

**Updated Governing Thought:**
> Conversion decline is concentrated in Commercial segments (-9.8pp) while Enterprise/Strategic are *improving*. The biggest risks are upstream pipeline quality issues, measurement inconsistency, and a demand gen model deployed to the wrong segments.

**Key Numbers:**
- 35 hypotheses tested | 11 claims contradicted | 7 high-confidence levers identified
- Recommendation: Option 4 (Hybrid Model) scored 4.20/5.00

*Footer: 2 | Cross-Decision Synthesis | CONFIDENTIAL*

**Presenter Notes:**
> "Our Day 1 hypothesis was 'systemic, not isolated.' That's confirmed--but with critical nuance."
>
> [pause]
>
> "The decline is NOT uniform. Commercial is falling apart. Enterprise and Strategic are improving. And more than 10 claims that shaped our internal narrative were wrong."

**Leave-Behind Notes:**
The executive summary uses the SCR framework, updated from the kickoff deck. **Situation:** Conversion decline is real, with a 29.8pp spread across channels and 50%+ slip rates. **Complication:** 11 major claims from internal memos were contradicted by data; the decline is concentrated in Commercial segments while Enterprise/Strategic are improving. **Resolution:** A Hybrid Model that deploys GSD to segments where it shows positive incrementality, redirects Enterprise GSD to Core Rep, and activates proven levers.
