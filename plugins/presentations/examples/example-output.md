## Slide 1: Pipeline Conversion Diagnostic - Root-Cause Analysis & Recommended Interventions

**Revenue Operations Analytics | February 2026**

For: CRO, VP Sales, VP Marketing

> **Presenter Notes**: Welcome everyone. Today we're presenting the findings from our 6-week pipeline conversion diagnostic. We analyzed 42 hypotheses across 5 decision areas using FY24-FY25 data. The bottom line: we found 7 proven levers and 11 commonly-held beliefs that the data contradicts. [PAUSE] Let's start with where we are.

> **Leave-Behind Notes**: This diagnostic examined pipeline conversion decline (31% to 25% win rate) across all sources, segments, and geographies. The study tested 42 hypotheses organized into 5 decision areas: source performance, sales execution, demand generation model, market fit, and measurement methodology. Key finding: a hybrid approach combining targeted GSD deployment with Core Rep reinforcement can recover 4-8pp of conversion.

## Slide 2: Win rates declined 6pp while pipeline grew 12%, pointing to execution and qualification gaps rather than volume

**Situation**: Pipeline generation is healthy (+12% YoY) but conversion efficiency is deteriorating across all channels.

| Metric | FY24 | FY25 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Win Rate | 31% | 25% | -6pp |
| Pipeline Volume | $XX.XB | $XX.XB | +12% |
| Quarterly Slip Rate | ~40% | 50%+ | +10pp |
| GSD Conversion | 30% | 15% | -15pp |

**Complication**: The decline is not uniform - it concentrates in Commercial segments and specific channels, while 11 commonly-held beliefs are contradicted by data.

**Resolution**: A hybrid model with measurement standardization can recover 4-8pp within 90 days using 7 proven levers.

> **Presenter Notes**: [BUILD] Start with the top line - we're generating more pipeline but converting less of it. [CLICK] The key insight is this isn't a volume problem, it's an efficiency problem. [PAUSE] And critically, many of the explanations we've been operating on don't hold up to statistical testing.

> **Leave-Behind Notes**: Pipeline conversion declined from 31% to 25% despite 12% volume growth. Quarterly slip rates exceed 50% against a 15-20% benchmark. The decline concentrates in Commercial segments (-9.8pp, -4.8pp) while Enterprise and Strategic segments are improving. GSD conversion halved from 30% to 15%. The study identified 7 statistically-validated levers for improvement and contradicted 11 commonly-held assumptions about root causes.
