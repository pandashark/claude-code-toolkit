# Board Readout - Quarterly Pipeline Health
# Demonstrates the board-readout deck type: shorter, strategic framing, less detail

title: "Q1 FY26 Pipeline Health"
subtitle: "Board Update: Conversion Recovery Progress"

executive_summary:
  situation: >
    Pipeline conversion diagnostic completed in February identified 7 proven
    levers and recommended a Hybrid Model (scored 4.20/5.00). Implementation
    began March 1 with measurement standardization as prerequisite.
  complication: >
    Early results are mixed: measurement standardization is complete but GSD
    segmentation is behind schedule due to capacity planning delays. Now Assist
    attach rate is accelerating faster than projected.
  resolution: >
    Maintain current trajectory on measurement and Now Assist. Accelerate GSD
    segmentation with temporary capacity bridge. Request board approval for
    Phase 2 investment.

methodology:
  scope: "90-day implementation tracking against 13 action items"
  approach: "Monthly measurement using standardized Cohort method"
  data_sources:
    - "Standardized pipeline reporting (Cohort method)"
    - "Loss prediction model scoring"
