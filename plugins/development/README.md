    }
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

### Required Plugins
- **claude-code-system** (^1.0.0): System status and configuration

### Optional MCP Tools
- **Sequential Thinking**: Enhances architect and code-reviewer structured reasoning
- **Serena**: Enables semantic code understanding (70-90% token reduction for code ops)
- **Context7**: Library documentation access for best practices

**Graceful Degradation**: All commands work without MCP tools.

## Best Practices

### Analysis Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start with high-level analysis
/analyze

# 2. Deep-dive into specific areas
/analyze src/auth --semantic --with-thinking

# 3. Review findings and plan improvements
```

### TDD Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start TDD mode
/test tdd

# 2. Write test first
# (test-engineer helps generate test cases)

# 3. Run test (should fail)
npm test

# 4. Implement feature

# 5. Run test (should pass)
npm test

# 6. Refactor

# 7. Repeat
```

### Review Workflow
```bash
# 1. Self-review before PR
/review --semantic

# 2. Fix HIGH priority issues
/fix review

# 3. Address MEDIUM priority
# (make changes manually or with /fix)

# 4. Re-review to verify
/review

# 5. Submit PR when clean
```

## Performance Considerations

### Serena Semantic Analysis
When Serena MCP is available:
- **Token Reduction**: 70-90% fewer tokens for code operations
- **Accuracy**: More precise symbol understanding
- **Speed**: Faster code navigation and search

**Enable Serena**:
```bash
/serena  # From core plugin
```

### Sequential Thinking
When Sequential Thinking is available:
- **Quality**: +20-30% better architectural decisions
- **Tokens**: +15-30% more tokens (but worth it for complex decisions)

**Automatic**: Used automatically by architect and code-reviewer when available

## Troubleshooting

### /analyze finds no issues
- Try `--with-thinking` for deeper analysis
- Use `--semantic` if Serena available
- Specify focus area: `/analyze src/problem-area`

### /test can't find test files
- Verify test framework installed
- Check test file patterns in config
- Ensure tests exist in standard locations

### /fix doesn't find errors
- Specify error source: `/fix error [file]`
- Try `/fix review` after running `/review`
- Check recent command output for errors

### /review gives too much feedback
- Set severity threshold in config
- Focus on specific areas: `/review src/module`
- Address HIGH priority first, iterate on others

## Metrics and Quality

The development plugin tracks:
- **Code quality**: Issues found, severity distribution
- **Test coverage**: Percentage covered, gaps identified
- **Review metrics**: Issues per 1000 lines, time to review
- **Fix success**: Fixes applied, tests passing after fix

View with:
```bash
/status verbose
/performance
```

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature with TDD
```bash
# Start TDD workflow
/test tdd

# Test-engineer generates test cases
# Implement feature to pass tests

# Run tests
npm test

# Review implementation
/review src/new-feature

# Fix any issues
/fix review

# Ship it
/ship --commit
```

### Example 2: Bug Investigation
```bash
# Analyze problem area
/analyze src/buggy-module --semantic

# Review code for bugs
/review src/buggy-module

# Fix identified issues
/fix review

# Run tests
npm test

# Verify fix
/test src/buggy-module
```

### Example 3: Architecture Review
```bash
# Get architect input
/agent architect "Review proposed microservices architecture"

# Analyze current architecture
/analyze --with-thinking

# Identify issues
/review --systematic

# Plan improvements based on findings
```
