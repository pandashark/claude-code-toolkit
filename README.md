## Overview

A collection of plugins, skills, and patterns developed through 6+ months of daily Claude Code use. Copy what works, adapt to your needs.

**What's included**: 23 commands, 5 agents, and 6 domain skills across 5 core plugins.

### Design Goals

1. **Stateless architecture** - Commands execute independently, state persisted in files
2. **File-based persistence** - JSON and Markdown for all state management
3. **MCP integration** - Optional Model Context Protocol tools with graceful degradation
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Load context incrementally to optimize token usage
5. **Self-containment** - All logic inline, no external script dependencies

### Key Capabilities

- **Workflow management**: `explore` → `plan` → `next` → `ship` pattern
- **Memory persistence**: Cross-session context with automatic reflection
- **Quality automation**: Git safety, pre/post hooks, compliance auditing
- **Code intelligence**: Semantic code understanding (Serena MCP), 70-90% token reduction
- **Domain expertise**: 6 skills across ML/AI and general development with measurable improvements

```

### Stateless Execution Model

All commands are **stateless markdown files** that execute in the project directory:

- No persistent processes or background services
- All state stored in `.claude/` directory (JSON/Markdown)
- Git serves as the state machine for work tracking
- Commands can be interrupted and resumed safely

**File-Based State Management**:
```
.claude/
├── work/
│   └── current/
│       └── [work-unit]/
│           ├── state.json              # Task tracking
│           ├── exploration.md          # Analysis
│           └── implementation-plan.md  # Task breakdown
├── memory/
│   ├── project-context.md              # Project knowledge
│   └── lessons-learned.md              # Accumulated insights
└── settings.json                       # Configuration
```

### MCP Integration Architecture

**Graceful Degradation Philosophy**: All functionality works without MCP, enhanced when available.

**Supported MCP Servers** (see [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md)):

| MCP Server | Impact | Token Change | Status |
|------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Sequential Thinking | Structured reasoning | +15-30% | Built-in (no setup) |
| Serena | Semantic code understanding | -70-90% | Optional (per-project) |
| Context7 | Documentation access | -50% | Optional (API key) |
| Chrome DevTools | Browser automation | Varies | Optional |
| FireCrawl | Web research | -40% | Optional (API key) |

**Commands auto-detect MCP availability** and fall back to standard operations when unavailable.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code 2.0+** ([installation](https://claude.com/install))
- **Git 2.0+**
- **jq** (JSON processing)
- **Node.js v20+ or v22+** (for MCP servers, optional)
- **mdtoken** (for contributors - `pip install mdtoken`)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/appliedaiconsulting/claude-code-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-toolkit

# Start Claude Code
claude

# In Claude Code, run:
/setup-project
```

### Manual Configuration

Add to project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "local": {
      "source": {
        "source": "directory",
        "path": "/path/to/claude-code-toolkit/plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "system@local": true,
    "workflow@local": true,
    "development@local": true,
    "transition@local": true,
    "memory@local": true
  }
}
```

### Git Safe Commit (Recommended)

Install the git safe-commit wrapper to enforce quality checks:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-safe-commit.sh
```

This installs `git-safe-commit` to `~/.local/bin/`, which:
- Blocks `--no-verify` flag to prevent bypassing quality checks
- Runs pre-commit hooks automatically
- Ensures all commits pass linting, formatting, and tests

**Usage**:
```bash
git safe-commit -m "feat: your commit message"
```

### MCP Setup (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, install MCP servers:

```bash
# Install Serena (semantic code understanding)
npm install -g @context7/serena-mcp

# Install Context7 (documentation access)
npm install -g @context7/context7-mcp

# Install Chrome DevTools (browser automation)
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer

# Install FireCrawl (web research)
npm install -g @firecrawl/mcp-server
```

See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for complete MCP integration guide.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow Pattern

The framework follows an `explore` → `plan` → `next` → `ship` pattern:

```bash
# 1. Explore requirements and codebase
/workflow:explore "add user authentication with JWT"

# Creates work unit in .claude/work/current/
# Analyzes requirements, identifies files to modify
# Documents dependencies and integration points

# 2. Create implementation plan
/workflow:plan

# Generates task breakdown with dependencies
# Stores in state.json for execution tracking

# 3. Execute tasks sequentially
/workflow:next

# Selects next available task (dependency-aware)
# Executes task with quality checks
# Auto-commits changes with descriptive message

# Repeat /next until all tasks complete

# 4. Deliver completed work
/workflow:ship

# Validates quality gates
# Creates pull request (if configured)
# Archives work unit
```

### Command Reference

**System Commands**:
- `/system:setup` - Project initialization (auto-detects Python/JavaScript)
- `/system:status` - Project and system health check
- `/system:audit` - Framework compliance validation
- `/system:cleanup` - Remove generated clutter

**Workflow Commands**:
- `/workflow:explore` - Analyze requirements and create work breakdown
- `/workflow:plan` - Generate implementation plan with dependencies
- `/workflow:next` - Execute next available task
- `/workflow:ship` - Deliver completed work
- `/workflow:work` - Manage work units and parallel streams
- `/workflow:spike` - Time-boxed exploration in isolated branch

**Development Commands**:
- `/development:analyze` - Deep codebase analysis
- `/development:review` - Code quality and security review
- `/development:test` - Test creation and TDD workflow
- `/development:fix` - Automated debugging and fixes
- `/development:git` - Git operations (commit, PR, issues)
- `/development:docs` - Documentation operations

**Transition Commands**:
- `/transition:handoff` - Create session handoff with context analysis
- `/transition:continue` - Resume from previous session handoff

**Memory Commands**:
- `/memory:index` - Create persistent project understanding
- `/memory:memory-update` - Update memory with new insights
- `/memory:memory-review` - Display current memory state
- `/memory:memory-gc` - Garbage collect stale entries
- `/memory:performance` - View token usage and metrics

**Note**: For semantic code understanding, use Serena MCP directly. See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for configuration.

### Specialized Agents

The framework includes 5 specialized agents that Claude Code can invoke via its native Task tool. Simply ask Claude to use an agent by name:

**Available Agents**:

| Agent | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `architect` | development | System design and architectural decisions |
| `test-engineer` | development | Test creation and coverage analysis |
| `code-reviewer` | development | Code quality and security audit |
| `auditor` | system | Infrastructure verification and compliance |
| `reasoning-specialist` | system | Complex analysis with structured reasoning |

**Usage** - just ask Claude directly:
```
"Use the architect agent to design the authentication system"
"Have the code-reviewer agent review this PR"
"Use the test-engineer agent to create tests for the user service"
```

Claude Code's Task tool will invoke the appropriate agent. No wrapper commands needed.

### Domain Skills (6 Skills)

Skills use **progressive disclosure** - they auto-load only when relevant to your task, providing deep domain expertise without polluting context.

#### ML/AI Skills (3 skills)

**RAG Implementation** (`rag-implementation`)
- Vector database selection (Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate)
- Chunking strategies and embedding models
- Retrieval optimization and hybrid search
- **Triggers**: "RAG", "vector database", "semantic search", "document retrieval"

**Hugging Face Transformers** (`huggingface-transformers`)
- Model loading and tokenization patterns
- Fine-tuning workflows (BERT, GPT, T5, LLaMA)
- Inference optimization (quantization, ONNX)
- **Triggers**: "transformers", "BERT", "fine-tune", "tokenizer", "Hugging Face"

**LLM Evaluation** (`llm-evaluation`)
- Prompt testing and validation
- Hallucination detection
- Benchmark creation and A/B testing
- **Triggers**: "LLM testing", "prompt evaluation", "hallucination", "LLM metrics"

#### General Development Skills (3 skills)

**Docker Optimization** (`docker-optimization`)
- Multi-stage builds for 85% size reduction (800MB → 120MB)
- Layer caching strategies for 50-80% faster builds
- Security hardening (non-root users, secrets management)
- **Triggers**: "Docker", "Dockerfile", "container size", "image optimization"
- **Demo value**: 800MB → 120MB Python image (real example included)

**SQL Optimization** (`sql-optimization`)
- EXPLAIN plan analysis across Postgres/MySQL/SQLite
- Index strategies (single, composite, partial, covering)
- N+1 query elimination and pagination optimization
- **Triggers**: "slow query", "EXPLAIN", "database performance", "SQL optimization"
- **Demo value**: 3s → 50ms query (60x speedup, real example included)

**API Authentication** (`api-authentication`)
- JWT, OAuth 2.0, API keys, session-based auth
- Decision matrix for choosing auth strategy
- Security best practices and vulnerability prevention
- **Triggers**: "authentication", "JWT", "OAuth", "API security", "login"
- **Demo value**: Secure auth on first try, prevents common vulnerabilities

#### How Skills Work

Skills activate automatically when your query matches their domain:

```bash
# Example 1: Docker skill auto-loads
"My Docker image is 800MB, how do I optimize it?"
> The "docker-optimization" skill is loading

# Example 2: SQL skill auto-loads
"This query takes 3 seconds, help me optimize it"
> The "sql-optimization" skill is loading

# Example 3: RAG skill auto-loads
"What's the best vector database for production RAG?"
> The "rag-implementation" skill is loading
```

**Benefits**:
- Load knowledge only when needed (no context pollution)
- 10-20KB of focused expertise per skill
- Before/after examples showing measurable improvements
- Works with progressive disclosure for optimal token efficiency

### Example Hook

The framework includes an example hook demonstrating the Claude Code hooks system:

#### Code Quality (`ruff-check-hook.sh`)
- Lints Python code for quality issues
- Catches unused imports, undefined names, syntax errors
- Claude sees the lint output and can act on it immediately
- **Demo**: Write code with unused import, see immediate linting feedback

**Why this hook is useful**: Unlike auto-formatting hooks (where Claude doesn't see the result), linting hooks provide actionable feedback that Claude can respond to in the same session.

**Installation**:
```bash
# Copy hook to ~/.claude/hooks/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp hooks/ruff-check-hook.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/ruff-check-hook.sh

# Configure in project's .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/ruff-check-hook.sh"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Creating Your Own Hooks**: See [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) for the hook data format and design tips

## Technical Details

### State Management

**Work Unit Structure**:
```json
{
  "work_unit_id": "003_auth_feature",
  "status": "implementing",
  "current_phase": "2",
  "phases": [
    {"id": "1", "name": "Analysis", "status": "completed"},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Implementation", "status": "in_progress"}
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "TASK-001",
      "title": "Create User model",
      "status": "completed",
      "dependencies": [],
      "actual_hours": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

**State persisted in** `.claude/work/current/[work-unit]/state.json`

### Token Optimization

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern**:
1. **Startup**: Load minimal metadata (~2KB)
2. **Task Analysis**: Load relevant commands/agents (~10KB)
3. **Execution**: Load detailed patterns only when needed (~5KB)

**Result**: 70%+ token savings vs. loading all documentation upfront.

**With Serena MCP**: Additional 70-90% reduction for code operations.

### Quality Gates

**Automatic Quality Checks**:
- **Pre-execution**: Dependency verification, environment checks
- **During execution**: API verification (via Serena), linting, tests
- **Post-execution**: Acceptance criteria validation, integration tests
- **Commit time**: Conventional commit format, attribution

### Git Safety

**Protected Operations**:
- No `git push --force` to main/master
- No `git commit --amend` of other developers' commits
- Pre-commit hook validation
- Automatic commit attribution

**Commit Format**:
```
feat: Complete TASK-XXX - Add JWT authentication

## Performance

### Benchmarks

**Token Usage** (typical feature development):
- Without MCP: ~150K tokens
- With Serena: ~30K tokens (80% reduction)
- With Sequential Thinking: ~180K tokens (+20%, higher quality)

**Time to First Value**:
- Project setup: <2 minutes
- First workflow execution: <5 minutes
- MCP server setup: <15 minutes

### Optimization Tips

**Maximize Serena Benefits**:
- Activate per-project for code-heavy work
- Keep index updated after major changes
- Use for all file reading and symbol lookup

**Efficient Memory Management**:
- Archive completed work units regularly
- Use `.claude/memory/` for project-specific knowledge
- Run `/memory:memory-gc` to clean stale entries

**Token Conservation**:
- Use progressive disclosure (load context incrementally)
- Leverage MCP tools for documentation lookup
- Prefer `/workflow:spike` for exploratory work (isolated, time-boxed)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Commands not found**

**A**: Verify plugins enabled in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "system@local": true,
    "workflow@local": true,
    "development@local": true,
    "transition@local": true,
    "memory@local": true
  }
}
```

**Q: MCP tools not working**

**A**: MCP servers are optional. Commands work without them but with reduced features. See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for installation.

**Q: Serena not activating**

**A**: Serena MCP requires per-project setup. See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for configuration. Use Serena tools directly:
```
mcp__serena__activate_project()
mcp__serena__find_symbol()
```

**Q: Tasks not executing**

**A**: Check for dependency blockers:
```bash
/workflow:next --status  # Shows task dependencies
```
