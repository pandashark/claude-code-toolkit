---

## Overview

A collection of plugins, skills, and patterns developed through 6+ months of daily Claude Code use. Copy what works, adapt to your needs.

**What's included**: 28 commands, 5 agents, and 6 domain skills across 6 core plugins.

### Design Goals

1. **Stateless architecture** - Commands execute independently, state persisted in files
2. **File-based persistence** - JSON and Markdown for all state management
3. **MCP integration** - Optional Model Context Protocol tools with graceful degradation
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Load context incrementally to optimize token usage
5. **Self-containment** - All logic inline, no external script dependencies

### Key Capabilities

- **Workflow management**: `explore` → `plan` → `next` → `ship` pattern
- **Memory persistence**: Cross-session context with automatic reflection
- **Quality automation**: Git safety, pre/post hooks, compliance auditing
- **MCP integration**: Optional tools (Serena, Sequential Thinking) with graceful degradation
- **Domain adaptation**: Examples showing how to extend Claude Code beyond software (quant, writing)

## Reality Check: The Limits of Customization

Before diving into the toolkit, understand what you're working with.

<br>

### The Instruction Training Boundary

Claude's behavior comes from two layers:

| Layer | What It Contains | Can You Change It? |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Instruction training** | Core personality, instincts, behavioral drivers | No—immutable |
| **Customization** | System prompts, CLAUDE.md, agent definitions | Yes—but limited |

No matter how clever your prompting, you're working with Claude's pre-trained personality. You can nudge it, structure it, guide it—but the underlying instincts remain.

<br>

### Behaviors You'll Encounter

**Sycophancy**

The tendency to agree, validate, and praise. We developed elaborate anti-sycophancy protocols—they failed. Give contradictory prompts and you'll still get "You're absolutely right!"

<br>

**Completion Bias**

The urge to deliver results regardless of completeness. Claude will proceed without full specifications, filling gaps with assumptions rather than asking. It's trained to deliver, not to pause and question.

<br>

**Action Over Reflection**

Bias toward doing, not critically examining. Tunnel vision on declared goals. Big picture thinking and honest pushback require deliberate prompting.

<br>

**Context Limitations**

The precious context window determines what Claude can "see." Important details get forgotten, overlooked, or deprioritized. Specify too much and things get lost; too little and Claude fills gaps incorrectly.

<br>

### What This Means for You

**Thorough inspection is non-negotiable.** Claude can make mistakes in every respect. Never assume output matches expectations—everything requires review, especially things that look correct.

<br>

**Proper testing is essential.** Validate behavior, not just structure. Test edge cases Claude may not have considered. Don't trust "it should work"—verify it does.

<br>

**The toolkit helps, but doesn't eliminate these behaviors.** We provide structure, workflows, and guardrails. Claude's base personality operates within that structure—sometimes it will frustrate you because it just wants to deliver.

<br>

### Why We're Honest About This

We removed dubious metrics from this toolkit ("80% token reduction," "zero hallucinations") because they weren't validated—and overclaiming doesn't help anyone.

Claude Code is genuinely powerful:

- Amazing at navigating complex codebases
- Excellent at using tools to solve problems
- Incredibly convenient in the terminal environment

But it has real limitations you'll encounter repeatedly. This toolkit provides patterns for working *with* those constraints rather than pretending they don't exist.

## Anthropic Best Practices Alignment

This toolkit implements patterns and recommendations from Anthropic's official Claude Code documentation. It represents "what Anthropic says you should be doing, here implemented."

![Anthropic Best Practices Alignment](assets/visualizations/06-best-practices.png)

### Multi-Context Window Workflows

**Anthropic Recommendation** ([Claude 4 Best Practices](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices)):
> "For complex, multi-step projects, we recommend starting with a first context window devoted to designing a structured representation of the project—tests, code stubs, documentation—that can be passed into subsequent context windows... Claude is adept at working across context window resets as long as clear instructions and todo lists are provided."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- `/workflow:explore` → `/workflow:plan` → `/workflow:next` → `/workflow:ship` workflow
- `state.json` tracks task status across sessions (equivalent to Anthropic's `tests.json`)
- `/transition:handoff` + `/transition:continue` for explicit context window transitions
- TodoWrite integration for progress tracking across resets

### State Tracking with JSON + Unstructured Notes + Git

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "JSON provides structured data about what still needs to be done... Unstructured progress notes can be easier for Claude to incrementally update... Git checkpoints let Claude 'save progress' so it has a safe state to roll back to."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- **JSON**: `state.json` (task tracking), `metadata.json` (work unit metadata)
- **Unstructured**: `exploration.md` (analysis notes), `implementation-plan.md` (task breakdown)
- **Git checkpoints**: Automatic commits after each `/workflow:next` task completion

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Anthropic Recommendation** ([Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills)):
> "Metadata Layer: Skill name and description are pre-loaded... Core Documentation: The full SKILL.md content loads when Claude determines relevance... Reference Materials: Additional linked files load only as needed."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- **Skills** (`skills/`) use Anthropic's exact 3-layer disclosure pattern
- **Plugins** load command metadata first, full instructions only when invoked
- **Memory** (`/memory:*`) stores context for retrieval, not constant presence
- **Result**: 70%+ token savings vs. loading everything upfront

### Model-Invoked vs User-Invoked Actions

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Skills are model-invoked—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This is different from slash commands, which are user-invoked."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- **Skills** (`skills/`): Model-invoked, Claude loads when domain-relevant (RAG, Docker, SQL, etc.)
- **Commands** (`commands/`): User-invoked via `/command` syntax
- **Agents** (`agents/`): Claude-selected via Task tool based on task complexity
- **Clear separation** between automatic (skills) and explicit (commands) invocation

### Memory Tool Patterns

**Anthropic Recommendation** ([Memory Tool Beta](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool)):
> "ALWAYS VIEW YOUR MEMORY DIRECTORY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE... Record status/progress/thoughts in your memory. ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context window might be reset at any moment."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- `.claude/memory/` directory for persistent project knowledge
- `/memory:index` creates persistent project understanding
- `/memory:memory-review` displays current memory state
- `/transition:handoff` saves critical context before session boundaries
- **Memory philosophy**: Write down key decisions, discard outdated information

### Quality Gates and Hooks

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Use pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality standards."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- `git-safe-commit` wrapper blocks `--no-verify` (no bypassing quality checks)
- `hooks/` directory for event handlers (pre/post tool use)
- Example `ruff-check-hook.sh` demonstrates actionable feedback patterns
- `/system:audit` validates framework compliance

### Subagent Architecture

**Anthropic Recommendation** ([Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)):
> "Use subagents for complex tasks that benefit from specialized focus... Each agent has its own context window, custom prompt, and can have restricted tool access."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- 5 specialized agents: `architect`, `test-engineer`, `code-reviewer`, `auditor`, `reasoning-specialist`
- Agents invoked via Claude Code's native Task tool
- Each agent has focused responsibility and appropriate tool permissions
- **Pattern**: Match agent specialization to task complexity

### Graceful Degradation

**Anthropic Recommendation** (implicit in MCP documentation):
> "All features should work without MCP tools, enhanced when available."

**Toolkit Implementation**:
- Every command works without MCP servers
- MCP enhances but never required for core functionality
- Commands auto-detect MCP availability and adapt
- Clear documentation of MCP benefits vs. baseline behavior

### Why This Alignment Matters

This toolkit evolved through **6+ months of daily Claude Code use**, facing the same pain points that Anthropic has been addressing in their platform improvements. Context limits, session boundaries, state persistence, quality degradation—these challenges are inherent to working with LLMs in development workflows.

It's no surprise that our solutions align with Anthropic's recommendations: **we're solving the same problems**. The toolkit represents practical responses to real stumbling blocks, which naturally mirror the priorities Anthropic has set for Claude Code itself.

This alignment validates that the patterns work—not because we followed a checklist, but because intensive daily use surfaces the same needs that drive platform evolution.

## Architecture: Six Plugins for Complete Workflows

The toolkit is organized into **six plugins**, each addressing a distinct aspect of Claude Code development:

| Plugin | Purpose | Anthropic Pattern |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **workflow** | Task execution lifecycle | Multi-context window workflows |
| **memory** | Persistent knowledge | Memory tool patterns |
| **transition** | Session boundaries | Context window handoffs |

```

### Stateless Execution Model

All commands are **stateless markdown files** that execute in the project directory:

- No persistent processes or background services
- All state stored in `.claude/` directory (JSON/Markdown)
- Git serves as the state machine for work tracking
- Commands can be interrupted and resumed safely

**File-Based State Management**:
```
.claude/
├── work/
│   └── current/
│       └── [work-unit]/
│           ├── state.json              # Task tracking
│           ├── exploration.md          # Analysis
│           └── implementation-plan.md  # Task breakdown
├── memory/
│   ├── project-context.md              # Project knowledge
│   └── lessons-learned.md              # Accumulated insights
└── settings.json                       # Configuration
```

### MCP Integration Architecture

**Graceful Degradation Philosophy**: All functionality works without MCP, enhanced when available.

**Supported MCP Servers** (see [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md)):

| MCP Server | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Sequential Thinking | Structured reasoning for complex analysis | Built-in (no setup) |
| Serena | Semantic code understanding | Optional (per-project) |
| Context7 | Documentation access | Optional (API key) |
| Chrome DevTools | Browser automation | Optional |
| FireCrawl | Web research | Optional (API key) |

**Note**: MCP tools have trade-offs. Serena helps with code operations but requires indexing overhead. Token efficiency varies by task and we haven't rigorously benchmarked specific percentages.

**Commands auto-detect MCP availability** and fall back to standard operations when unavailable.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code 2.0+** ([installation](https://claude.com/install))
- **Git 2.0+**
- **jq** (JSON processing)
- **Node.js v20+ or v22+** (for MCP servers, optional)
- **mdtoken** (for contributors - `pip install mdtoken`)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/applied-artificial-intelligence/claude-code-toolkit.git
cd claude-code-toolkit

# Install the setup command globally (one-time)
cp commands/setup-toolkit.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Now in ANY project, start Claude Code and run:
claude
/setup-toolkit
```

The `/setup-toolkit` command works in any project directory—before any plugins are installed. It:
- Detects your project type (Python, JavaScript, web, etc.)
- Asks which plugins and MCP servers you want
- Creates `.claude/settings.json` with proper configuration
- Sets up the plugin marketplace connection

### Manual Configuration

Add to project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "local": {
      "source": {
        "source": "directory",
        "path": "/path/to/claude-code-toolkit/plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "system@local": true,
    "workflow@local": true,
    "development@local": true,
    "transition@local": true,
    "memory@local": true,
    "setup@local": true
  }
}
```

### Git Safe Commit (Recommended)

Install the git safe-commit wrapper to enforce quality checks:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-safe-commit.sh
```

This installs `git-safe-commit` to `~/.local/bin/`, which:
- Blocks `--no-verify` flag to prevent bypassing quality checks
- Runs pre-commit hooks automatically
- Ensures all commits pass linting, formatting, and tests

**Usage**:
```bash
git safe-commit -m "feat: your commit message"
```

### Session History Search (NEW in v1.1.0)

Claude Code already captures complete session history in `~/.claude/projects/`. The toolkit includes tools to query this data for questions like:
- "How did we implement X last time?"
- "What happened about Y in the last 2 days?"
- "Didn't we already do this?"

**Quick start**:
```bash
# Build the search index (one-time, then incremental)
python3 scripts/session-db.py index

# Search across all projects
python3 scripts/session-db.py search "authentication"

# Filter by project and time
python3 scripts/session-db.py search "backtest" --project ml4t --days 7

# See recent activity timeline
python3 scripts/session-db.py timeline --days 2

# Find file changes
python3 scripts/session-db.py files "cli_interface" --days 7
```

**What it indexes**:
- All tool calls (Bash commands, file edits, reads, searches)
- Timestamps for temporal queries
- Cross-project search capability

**Performance**: Indexes 2000+ sessions (90K+ actions) in ~3 seconds. Queries return in <30ms.

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for full documentation.

### MCP Setup (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, install MCP servers:

```bash
# Install Serena (semantic code understanding)
npm install -g @context7/serena-mcp

# Install Context7 (documentation access)
npm install -g @context7/context7-mcp

# Install Chrome DevTools (browser automation)
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer

# Install FireCrawl (web research)
npm install -g @firecrawl/mcp-server
```

See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for complete MCP integration guide.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow Pattern

The framework follows an `explore` → `plan` → `next` → `ship` pattern:

> **Relationship to Claude's Built-in Plan Mode**: Claude Code includes a built-in `EnterPlanMode` that creates plans in `~/.claude/plans/` with auto-generated names (like `zany-cooking-wombat`). Our workflow **complements** this:
>
> | Feature | Built-in Plan Mode | Our Workflow |
> |---------|-------------------|--------------|
> | **Storage** | Global `~/.claude/plans/` | Project-local `.claude/work/` |
> | **Naming** | Auto-generated | Date-based (`2025-11-27_01_feature`) |
> | **Execution** | Implements entire plan at once | Incremental via `/next` |
> | **State tracking** | None | `state.json` with task progress |
> | **Session resume** | Cannot resume mid-plan | Work units persist across handoffs |
>
> **Best practice**: Use Claude's built-in plan mode *during* `/explore` or `/plan` for enhanced reasoning, while our workflow handles organization and incremental execution. They work together.

```bash
# 1. Explore requirements and codebase
/workflow:explore "add user authentication with JWT"

# Creates work unit in .claude/work/current/
# Analyzes requirements, identifies files to modify
# Documents dependencies and integration points

# 2. Create implementation plan
/workflow:plan

# Generates task breakdown with dependencies
# Stores in state.json for execution tracking

# 3. Execute tasks sequentially
/workflow:next

# Selects next available task (dependency-aware)
# Executes task with quality checks
# Auto-commits changes with descriptive message

# Repeat /next until all tasks complete

# 4. Deliver completed work
/workflow:ship

# Validates quality gates
# Creates pull request (if configured)
# Archives work unit
```

### Specialized Agents

The framework includes 5 specialized agents that Claude Code can invoke via its native Task tool. Simply ask Claude to use an agent by name:

**Available Agents**:

| Agent | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `architect` | development | System design and architectural decisions |
| `test-engineer` | development | Test creation and coverage analysis |
| `code-reviewer` | development | Code quality and security audit |
| `auditor` | system | Infrastructure verification and compliance |
| `reasoning-specialist` | system | Complex analysis with structured reasoning |

**Usage** - just ask Claude directly:
```
"Use the architect agent to design the authentication system"
"Have the code-reviewer agent review this PR"
"Use the test-engineer agent to create tests for the user service"
```

Claude Code's Task tool will invoke the appropriate agent. No wrapper commands needed.

### Domain Skills (6 Skills)

Skills use **progressive disclosure** - they auto-load only when relevant to your task, providing deep domain expertise without polluting context.

#### General Development Skills (3 skills)

**Docker Optimization** (`docker-optimization`)
- Multi-stage builds for 85% size reduction (800MB → 120MB)
- Layer caching strategies for 50-80% faster builds
- Security hardening (non-root users, secrets management)
- **Triggers**: "Docker", "Dockerfile", "container size", "image optimization"

**SQL Optimization** (`sql-optimization`)
- EXPLAIN plan analysis across Postgres/MySQL/SQLite
- Index strategies (single, composite, partial, covering)
- N+1 query elimination and pagination optimization
- **Triggers**: "slow query", "EXPLAIN", "database performance", "SQL optimization"

**API Authentication** (`api-authentication`)
- JWT, OAuth 2.0, API keys, session-based auth
- Decision matrix for choosing auth strategy
- Security best practices and vulnerability prevention
- **Triggers**: "authentication", "JWT", "OAuth", "API security", "login"

#### ML/AI Skills (3 skills)

**RAG Implementation** (`rag-implementation`)
- Vector database selection (Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate)
- Chunking strategies and embedding models
- Retrieval optimization and hybrid search
- **Triggers**: "RAG", "vector database", "semantic search", "document retrieval"

**Hugging Face Transformers** (`huggingface-transformers`)
- Model loading and tokenization patterns
- Fine-tuning workflows (BERT, GPT, T5, LLaMA)
- Inference optimization (quantization, ONNX)
- **Triggers**: "transformers", "BERT", "fine-tune", "tokenizer", "Hugging Face"

**LLM Evaluation** (`llm-evaluation`)
- Prompt testing and validation
- Hallucination detection
- Benchmark creation and A/B testing
- **Triggers**: "LLM testing", "prompt evaluation", "hallucination", "LLM metrics"

#### How Skills Work

Skills activate automatically when your query matches their domain:

```bash
# Example 1: Docker skill auto-loads
"My Docker image is 800MB, how do I optimize it?"
> The "docker-optimization" skill is loading

# Example 2: SQL skill auto-loads
"This query takes 3 seconds, help me optimize it"
> The "sql-optimization" skill is loading

# Example 3: RAG skill auto-loads
"What's the best vector database for production RAG?"
> The "rag-implementation" skill is loading
```

**Benefits**:
- Load knowledge only when needed (no context pollution)
- 10-20KB of focused expertise per skill
- Works with progressive disclosure for optimal token efficiency

### Domain Adaptation Examples

**Claude Code isn't just for software.** The `examples/` directory shows how to extend Claude Code to other domains.

**The Knowledge Encoding Problem**: When adapting to a new domain, where do you put domain knowledge?

| Level | What Goes Here | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Agent Definition | General awareness | "Look-ahead bias is a problem" |
| Skills/Validators | Specific checkpoints | "Check: `scaler.fit(X)` BEFORE `train_test_split`" |
| Commands | Workflow steps | `explore` → `plan` → `next` → `ship` |

**The insight**: General awareness isn't enough. You need specific, actionable checkpoints.

**Included Examples**:

**Quantitative Finance** (`examples/quant/`)
- 3 validators with 21 specific patterns
- `quant-ml-validator`: Look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, wrong CV
- `quant-backtest-validator`: Missing costs, unrealistic fills
- `quant-risk-validator`: No kill switch, unlimited leverage
- Each pattern: detection regex + quantified impact + specific fix

**Professional Writing** (`examples/writing/`)
- 3 framework skills
- `pyramid-principle`: Barbara Minto's answer-first structure
- `scqa-framework`: Situation-Complication-Question-Answer narrative
- `plain-language`: Federal plain language guidelines

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for full documentation.

---

### Example Hook

The framework includes an example hook demonstrating the Claude Code hooks system:

#### Code Quality (`ruff-check-hook.sh`)
- Lints Python code for quality issues
- Catches unused imports, undefined names, syntax errors
- Claude sees the lint output and can act on it immediately
- **Demo**: Write code with unused import, see immediate linting feedback

**Why this hook is useful**: Unlike auto-formatting hooks (where Claude doesn't see the result), linting hooks provide actionable feedback that Claude can respond to in the same session.

**Installation**:
```bash
# Copy hook to ~/.claude/hooks/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp hooks/ruff-check-hook.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/ruff-check-hook.sh

# Configure in project's .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/ruff-check-hook.sh"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Creating Your Own Hooks**: See [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) for the hook data format and design tips

## Workflow Examples

### Context Management: /handoff → /continue

**Scenario**: Managing context across sessions to prevent quality degradation.

> **The Hidden Value of Transitions**: Beyond session continuity, transitions create an **automatic project history**. Every `/handoff` captures decisions, reasoning, and context—creating an audit trail far more valuable than commit messages. Over time, `.claude/transitions/` becomes a chronological record of *why* things were done, not just *what* changed.

```bash
# At 70% perceived context usage (~85% actual)
/handoff

# Creates .claude/transitions/2025-11-25/143052.md with:
# - Session focus and active work state
# - Recent decisions and outstanding items
# - Todo list state and next steps

# After /clear, resume seamlessly:
/continue

# Automatically loads latest handoff, restores context
```

**Key features**:

## Technical Details

### State Management

**Work Unit Structure**:
```json
{
  "work_unit_id": "003_auth_feature",
  "status": "implementing",
  "current_phase": "2",
  "phases": [
    {"id": "1", "name": "Analysis", "status": "completed"},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Implementation", "status": "in_progress"}
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "TASK-001",
      "title": "Create User model",
      "status": "completed",
      "dependencies": [],
      "actual_hours": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

**State persisted in** `.claude/work/current/[work-unit]/state.json`

### Token Optimization

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern**:
1. **Startup**: Load minimal metadata (~2KB)
2. **Task Analysis**: Load relevant commands/agents (~10KB)
3. **Execution**: Load detailed patterns only when needed (~5KB)

**Philosophy**: Load context incrementally rather than all at once. Actual savings vary by task.

### Quality Gates

**Automatic Quality Checks**:
- **Pre-execution**: Dependency verification, environment checks
- **During execution**: API verification (via Serena), linting, tests
- **Post-execution**: Acceptance criteria validation, integration tests
- **Commit time**: Conventional commit format, attribution

### Git Safety

**Protected Operations**:
- No `git push --force` to main/master
- No `git commit --amend` of other developers' commits
- Pre-commit hook validation
- Automatic commit attribution

**Commit Format**:
```

## Development

### Building Custom Plugins

**Plugin Structure**:
```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json           # Manifest (required)
├── commands/                 # Slash commands (optional)
│   └── my-command.md
├── agents/                   # Specialized agents (optional)
│   └── my-agent.md
└── hooks/                    # Event handlers (optional)
    └── hooks.json
```

**Minimal plugin.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My custom plugin",
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "my-command",
      "description": "Does something useful",
      "file": "commands/my-command.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install mdtoken pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Token Limit Enforcement with mdtoken

This toolkit uses [**mdtoken**](https://github.com/applied-artificial-intelligence/mdtoken)—a companion tool we built to prevent markdown files from growing unbounded.

**The Problem**: Plugin commands, memory files, and documentation grow over time. When they exceed context limits, Claude silently loses information or truncates content.

**The Solution**: mdtoken enforces token limits as a pre-commit hook. Commits fail fast if any markdown file exceeds its configured limit.

```yaml
# .mdtokenrc.yaml (included in this repo)
default_limit: 3500
limits:
  "README.md": 25000
  "plugins/**/commands/*.md": 3500
  "plugins/**/agents/*.md": 4000
```

**Installation**:
```bash
pip install mdtoken
```

**Usage**:
```bash
mdtoken check              # Check all markdown files
mdtoken check README.md    # Check specific file
```

See [mdtoken repo](https://github.com/applied-artificial-intelligence/mdtoken) for full documentation.

## Performance

### Time to First Value

- Project setup: <2 minutes
- First workflow execution: <5 minutes
- MCP server setup: <15 minutes (optional)

**Note**: Token efficiency varies by task. MCP tools like Serena can help with code operations but have their own overhead (indexing). We haven't rigorously benchmarked specific percentages.

### Optimization Tips

**Maximize Serena Benefits**:
- Activate per-project for code-heavy work
- Keep index updated after major changes
- Use for all file reading and symbol lookup

**Efficient Memory Management**:
- Archive completed work units regularly
- Use `.claude/memory/` for project-specific knowledge
- Run `/memory:memory-gc` to clean stale entries

**Token Conservation**:
- Use progressive disclosure (load context incrementally)
- Leverage MCP tools for documentation lookup
- Prefer `/workflow:spike` for exploratory work (isolated, time-boxed)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Commands not found**

**A**: Verify plugins enabled in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "system@local": true,
    "workflow@local": true,
    "development@local": true,
    "transition@local": true,
    "memory@local": true,
    "setup@local": true
  }
}
```

**Q: MCP tools not working**

**A**: MCP servers are optional. Commands work without them but with reduced features. See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for installation.

**Q: Serena not activating**

**A**: Serena MCP requires per-project setup. See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for configuration. Use Serena tools directly:
```
mcp__serena__activate_project()
mcp__serena__find_symbol()
```

**Q: Tasks not executing**

**A**: Check for dependency blockers:
```bash
/workflow:next --status  # Shows task dependencies
```

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check plugin README files for detailed command usage
- **System Health**: Run `/system:status` to verify framework setup
- **Compliance**: Run `/system:audit` to check for issues
- **GitHub Issues**: https://github.com/applied-artificial-intelligence/claude-code-toolkit/issues
